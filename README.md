## Introduction

This guide walks you through recovering a bricked Xiaomi tablet (specifically, the Xiaomi Pad 6 "Pipa") using EDL (Emergency Download) mode. This method is useful when your tablet is unresponsive or fails to boot normally due to firmware issues.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This procedure may void your warranty if discovered. Proceed at your own risk. Alternatively, you can claim warranty service (the service center will likely perform a similar procedure but may claim they are "replacing the motherboard").

## Prerequisites

- A Windows PC (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- A USB cable to connect your tablet to the PC
- Basic familiarity with using the command prompt
- Patience (this process can be finicky)

## Tools Required

1. Qualcomm USB Drivers
2. Xiaomi EDL Flash Tool
3. The correct firmware for your device

## Step 1: Download Required Files

Download the following files:

- **Qualcomm USB Driver:** `È´òÈÄöÂÆòÊñπÂÖ®Á´ØÂè£usbÈ©±Âä®-qud.win.1.1_installer_10061.1.exe` from telegram : t.me/mx7111
- **Qualcomm Toolbox:** `È´òÈÄöÂ∑•ÂÖ∑ÁÆ±.7z`
- **Firmware for your device:** For example, for the Xiaomi Pad 6, visit [XMFirmwareUpdater](https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/hyperos/pipa/stable/OS1.0.15.0.UMZMIXM/)

> üí° **Tip:** Ensure you obtain the correct firmware for your specific device model. Using incorrect firmware can further brick your device.

## Step 2: Install Qualcomm USB Drivers

1. Run the Qualcomm USB driver installer: `È´òÈÄöÂÆòÊñπÂÖ®Á´ØÂè£usbÈ©±Âä®-qud.win.1.1_installer_10061.1.exe`
2. Follow the installation prompts.
3. Restart your PC to ensure the drivers are properly registered.

## Step 3: Extract and Prepare the Flash Tool

1. Extract the Qualcomm Toolbox (`È´òÈÄöÂ∑•ÂÖ∑ÁÆ±.7z`) to a folder.
   
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Extract to a path with **no spaces or special characters.**
   >
   > ‚úÖ **Good:** `D:\Xiaomi_Flash` or `C:\XiaomiTools`
   >
   > ‚ùå **Bad:** `C:\Xiaomi Flash Tool` or `D:\My Tools\Xiaomi`

2. Download and extract your device firmware to a folder (again, ensure the path contains no spaces).

## Step 4: Connect Your Device in EDL Mode

When your bricked device is connected to the PC, it should automatically enter EDL mode:

1. The device display will remain blank.
2. In Device Manager, it should be detected as **"Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008."**
3. Keep your device connected via USB and verify its detection in Device Manager.

## Step 5: Run the Flash Tool

1. Launch the flashing tool application.

2. If you encounter error messages regarding spaces in the path, ensure that the tool is extracted to a folder without spaces.

3. When prompted, select the **Firehose** option (preferably the "dd" version) and point the tool to your extracted firmware folder.

4. The tool will attempt to connect to your device in 9008 (EDL) mode. If a red indicator appears, this typically indicates a timeout error‚Äîpossibly due to Windows interfering with the connection.
5. If the connection is successful, click the designated button (as shown in the image below) to proceed:

6. The tool will then prompt you to select the `rawprogram.xml` file, followed by the `patch.xml` file. After making these selections, the flashing process will commence.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Device Not Detected in EDL Mode

- Try a different USB port (preferably a USB 2.0 port directly on the motherboard).
- Use a different USB cable.
- Ensure the Qualcomm USB drivers are correctly installed.
- Check Device Manager for the **"Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008"** entry.

### Error Messages During Flashing

If you encounter errors such as:

- **"Spaces or brackets are not allowed in the toolbox path"**
  - **Solution:** Extract the tool to a folder without spaces or special characters.

- **"Boot failed, please re-enter the device into 9008"**
  - **Solution:** 
    1. Disconnect and reconnect your device.
    2. Try a different USB port.
    3. Ensure the device has sufficient battery charge.

### Windows-Specific Issues

If you continue to experience driver problems on Windows:

1. Temporarily disable Windows Defender or your antivirus software.
2. Run the tools as an Administrator.
3. As a last resort, consider using a minimal Windows installation like Tiny11 for improved driver compatibility.

## Warranty Considerations

- If you are unable to recover your device and need to claim warranty service:
  1. The service center will likely perform a similar procedure but may claim that the motherboard needs to be replaced.
  2. They generally cannot detect if you have attempted this recovery procedure.
  3. For warranty claims, simply state that the device stopped working suddenly.

## Conclusion

With patience and careful execution, this method should restore your bricked Xiaomi tablet to working condition. If issues persist, consider seeking help from Xiaomi device recovery communities.
